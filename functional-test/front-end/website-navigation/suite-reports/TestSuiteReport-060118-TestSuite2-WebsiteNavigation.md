## Test Suite desctription
Project Name: pareture website
Project Source Code: https://github.com/njgibbon/pareture
Project Website base URL: https://pareture.xyz

Test Plan: https://github.com/njgibbon/pareture-test/blob/master/TestPlan-Pareture.md

Test Phase: 2 - Functional Test
Test Area: Front End

Primary Goal: 

1: Showing that all navigation to internal and external links is sound. 

Secondary Goal:

1: Use WebDriver Automation and screen-recording for evidence. 
This can then be cited as evidence in other test-suites. 
i.e the User Experience suite

2: As the application is small we can go through the entire sites functionality in a short period of time (< 1 min).
We can re-run this and watch the execution for confidence / smoke / regression testing.
