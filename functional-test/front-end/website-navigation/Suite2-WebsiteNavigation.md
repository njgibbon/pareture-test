Suite Reporting: -
Phase Reporting: -

Primary Goal: 

1: Showing that all navigation to internal and external links is sound. 

Secondary Goal:

1: Use WebDriver Automation and screen-recording for evidence. 
This can then be cited as evidence in other test-suites. 
i.e User Experience

2: As the application is small we can go through the entire sites functionality in a short period of time (< 1 min).
We can re-run this and watch the execution for confidence / smoke / regression testing.
