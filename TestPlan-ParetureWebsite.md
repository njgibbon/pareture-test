# pareture-test
Test project for the basic static website https://pareture.xyz

Notes:
Here the totality of the test cases are the requirements. 
I will assess 
Therefor 100% requirements cexercised mean all tests excuted. 100% requirement coverage means that I deem that no more identified test-cases need be added to provide confience in the objects under test. 

Test after commit and already 'live' due to low risk and unreasonable to create a none-public stage environment.



Retest: 0 // not counted but give reason
Identification in test design is implicit. 
Some redundancy in suite and suite-report for completeness of doc. make report more useful. acceptible re-work to sort out changes. 
include white box, black box and experimental. identify techniques in the test plan not at the suite level as it is extraneous there.
Will include positive and negative tag at the suite level. 

Results: each test can only have one category

Notes: Major wins and issues - important to talk about positives in test as negatives usually accerntuated.

Not Ready: 0 -> not prepared, blockers (env etc.), not released, look at on case by case

see test prep status for this. 

pages have self links for if they were to be used elsewhere. 

suite is living documentation

report is snapshot

issues which to pertain to all tests and not one or two will not be reflected as an issue against that test design/prep/exec but instead against the suite as a whole. 

passes dont always require evidence especially if awkward to obtain, but better if you do. fails always require evidence and defects raised.

notes should be append to. not overwrite. so history is observed. 

Defect management:  
Defects raised against repo and will have tag of if it is a test, suite or phase level issue. 

testing only records feature test and re-test / confirmation test. regression issues would be recorded elsewhere as assumed to be temporary. Only would be bought into the mould if somehow stayed permanent after defect / incident /issue resolution. 

Regression executed based on change (to x y z, following mutation model), based on potential impact area assessment

Resolution information linked to 

user interface should come under functional but user experience under NFR as a subjective set.
