Test Suite 1

Name: Website Navigation

Test Project: pareture.xyz website

Test Plan: link

Test Phase: Functional testing

Test Area: Front-End

Primary Goal: 

1: Showing that all navigation to internal and external links is sound. 

Secondary Goal:

1: Use WebDriver Automation and screen-recording for evidence. 
This can then be cited as evidence in other test-suites. 
i.e User Experience

2: As the application is small we can go through the entire sites functionality in a short period of time (< 1 min).
We can re-run this and watch the execution for confidence / smoke / regression testing.
